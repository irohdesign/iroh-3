	  <h1>Overview</h1>

	  		<p>Minkebell is a blog that I built to promote the exceptional music that I find. I originally built it as an exercise in web development, but it grew to take a life of its own after I showed it to local musicians. My website serves as a bridge between bands looking for heightened visibility, and music enthusiasts looking for their newest obsession.</p>

	  		<p>I wanted to create a site that focuses on finding and promoting interesting music. I built Minkebell around the ideal of a simple, easy to use blog with the artists front and center.</p>
  </section><!-- over -->

  <section id="chall" class="case-study-body">
	   <h1>The Challenge &amp; The Solution</h1>

		<p>I built the first iteration of Minkebell as a simple exercise in building static websites. I wanted to see what other music lovers thought, so I shared the site with a number of local musicians.</p>

		<p>I was immediately overwhelmed by bands looking to be reviewed and local audiophiles looking for more articles to read. <strong>I didn't have a way to easily update and maintain the site,</strong> so I couldn't publish at a reasonable pace.</p>

		<p>I didn’t know enough about web development to satisfy the demand for more content, so I took a step back to learn more. I took courses in Javascript, PHP, Bootstrap and Wordpress. I researched Search Engine Optimization (SEO) techniques, Usability best practices and Responsive Web Design to add more and more tools to my skill set.</p>

		<p>I knew that I would need a simpler way to update and manage content, so I chose <strong>Wordpress as my CMS and rebuilt the site in PHP</strong>. I used MAMP to set up a local server for the majority of the build, and then transferred the database content in MySQL to the database of the live site.</p>

		<p>Minkebell is my biggest project to date, so I learned to use Git from the Command Line. This meant I could commit changes to my Github Account with more control and easily retrieve data when I came back to my work later.</p>

 <section id="des" class="case-study-body">
	 <h1>Design Process</h1>

	 <p>I come from a content writing background, so I started off this build like I would any other project. <strong>With research.</strong></p>

<p>I looked through dozens of top music blogs, writing down what I liked and disliked as a musician, as a reader, and as a developer. My three primary sites were <a href="https://pitchfork.com">Pitchfork</a>, <a href="https://drownedinsound.com">Drowned in Sound</a>, and <a href="https://npr.org/music/">NPR Music.</a></p>

<p>As a musician, I was frustrated by the lack of audio content in music reviews. If I’m reading about the intricacies of an album, I want to be able to hear the album at the same time. Too many reviews had audio that was either difficult to find, or completely absent.</p>

<p>As a reader, I disliked that I couldn’t find direct links to the artists being reviewed. I’m not interested in the reviewer, I’m interested in the music. There are always links to share the review, but rarely direct links to the artist’s social media or other original content.</p>

<p>Finally, as a developer, autoplay was a red flag. Not only did it interrupt my experience of browsing at each separate page I loaded, it’s terrible for usability. Screen readers struggle with autoplaying elements; they interfere with navigation, can be difficult to turn off, and can distract users with attention issues <a href="">(Understanding Success Criterion 2.2.2)</a></p>

		<div id="prereq" class="row">
			<p>After looking through these sites, I decided that I needed to have:</p>
			<div id="line" class="hidden-xs"></div>
		<div class="col-sm-4">
			<h2>1</h2>
			<p>Interactive music elements easily available throughout my reviews</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-4">
			<h2>2</h2>
			<p>Clear links to the artist’s social media and original content</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-4">
			<h2>3</h2>
			<p>Simple to update design that puts the music at the forefront</p>

	 <h1>Build Process</h1>

		<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/126190115&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe>

		<h3>Interactive Audio</h3>
			 <p>My first decision in the building process was figuring out <strong>how I was going to integrate music dynamically.</strong> I considered building a custom plugin, but it would add too much weight to the code and force the user to take an additional step in navigating the new interface. I used recognizable music players (Soundcloud, Youtube and iTunes) as IFrames to simplify the process. Users are familiar with the appearance and they are able to click into the apps to download songs directly, instead of having to look them up independently.</p>



<p>I also built a weekly playlist modal in the Home Page, with custom PHP variables nested in the URL of the HTML IFrame tag. This way, when I want to update the playlist, I only need to copy the URL from the application and paste it into my custom field in WordPress’s front end. No coding needed. Users are able to open the playlist in the application with a single click and download it directly to their device.</p>

			  <h3>Social Media</h3>
			  <p>I put the artist’s social media at the top of each review, with clear links to their Soundcloud, Facebook and Youtube accounts. I chose the three platforms because Facebook is where local bands typically publicize their upcoming events, Youtube is the main avenue for publishing live footage of concerts, and Soundcloud is commonly used by independent bands to share music (so it made more sense than iTunes, which focuses on established artists).</p>




<p>While experimenting with the first iteration, I found an unexpected result of prioritizing musician’s visibility. Those musicians give that attention right back. The local bands were so excited to have published reviews that they would share my work on their social media, which would bring their fans to the site, and it ended up becoming a mutually beneficial relationship. The bands apply to be featured because they want to reach a new audience, and my site gets new readers because they bring their existing fanbase through sharing the review.</p>

<p>This accidental discovery is what ended up pushing me to upgrade the site from a static experimental project to a fully dynamic Custom Wordpress theme. By working with local musicians, <strong> we grow together.</strong></p>

	 <h3>Usability</h3>

<p>I prioritized my own experience as the author by making the site dynamic. I used PHP and custom fields to display information with simple updates directly from the post portal itself. By defining custom variables in the PHP and connecting them to custom fields in Wordpress, I’m able to quickly change images, featured posts and backgrounds as time goes on.</p>



<p>I added functions to my PHP files to create a checkbox in the front end of Wordpress to allow posts to be featured with a single click. That information is grabbed by a PHP loop and then displayed in the featured slot I built into the Home Page.</p>

<p>I built the website first as a static template, using Bootstrap and custom CSS media queries to ensure the project was fully responsive and worked across different browsers. I then took that template and translated it into PHP so it would be easier to update and still be friendly to all screen sizes.</p>

  <section id="issue">
	   <h2>Roadblock</h2>

		  <p>My main obstacle to completing the site was the connection between my CSS files and the Wordpress PHP. I would create a beautiful, comprehensive stylesheet, but it wouldn't seem to connect in the right way. The majority of the styles would be applied, but certain elements, most notably, the navigation, wouldn't fall in line.</p>

<p>After hours of slamming my head into the keyboard and reading various theories on StackOverflow regarding navigation plugins and widgets, I decided to try <strong>browser developer tools.</strong></p>

<p>Different content management systems insert classes when processing your code, so I wondered if it could be adding elements as well. I used Google Chrome’s Developer Tools to look under the hood and better target my CSS and Javascript.</p>

<p>I figured out that Wordpress was adding an unordered list into the container of my main navigation and by doing that, throwing off the structure of my entire header file. By focusing in and approaching the issue from a different angle, I was able to rewrite those styles and they applied seamlessly.</p>

	  <h1>Outcome</h1>

	  <p>I’ve been building Minkebell throughout my learning process as a web developer. I started out learning wire framing in Photoshop with my original ideas. I built the first static iteration as an exercise in HTML and CSS. The unexpected demand for the site pushed me to get better and better as a developer and brought me closer to the local music scene.</p>

<p>Minkebell’s newest iteration is still in its infancy, but with a long waitlist of bands to be renewed and plans already underway to accommodate the increase in content, I’m looking forward to where it goes.</p>
